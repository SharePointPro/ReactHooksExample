This project is an example of using React Hooks and global state to replace Redux.
It uses a higher order component at the top level to replace the redux store.

This project is an React Hooks & Create React App implementation of React Redux project https://github.com/robertbg/swapi-react

While it maybe a good alternative to Redux, react hooks was not designed to replace Redux. If you are making frequent changes to a store you should conisder using Redux rather than React Hooks.

However for infrequent changes (ie not on keypress's) react hooks can help minimize your project size.
